# Coursework 2 Source Files

Implement your solution as `.kt` files in this directory.

Note that the Gradle build file expects there to be a file named `main.kt`
or `Main.kt`, containing the `main()` function that implements the program.
Beyond that requirement, it's up to you how you arrange things here - but
remember that each source file will need this as a package declaration:

    package comp3222.cwk2
